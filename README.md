# Real-Time Sales Analytics Platform  
*Snowflake + dbt + Kafka + Airflow + Azure Storage*

A production-style data platform that streams e-commerce events into Kafka, lands raw data in cloud storage, loads it to Snowflake, transforms it with dbt, and orchestrates the pipeline end-to-end with Airflow.  
Includes **data quality checks**, **dimensional models**, and a ready-to-use analytics layer.
